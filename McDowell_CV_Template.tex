		\begin{cvsubsection}{Senior Software Engineer}{Netflix}{2019 -- Present}	

			\textit{Network State Collection and Ingest}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implemented dynamic collection configuration loading without system redeploy.
				\item Added multi-region support to shard out state collection to the nearest AWS region.
				\item Implemented support for parameterized "command sets", allowing users to pass in and validate parameters to common commands, enabling vendor agnostic execution of common groups of commands.
				\item Implemented translation of collected state data from numerous vendors into a vendor agnostic datastore.
			\end{itemize}
			\bigskip
			\textit{Configuration Deployment}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Updated backend datastore for core deployment system from Cassandra to CockroachDB.
				\item Implemented pluggable stages to allow for configuration merge, configuration replace, and OpenConfig deployment strategies while maintaining common render and backup functionality where applicable.
				\item Implemented a gRPC API to front the system, allowing for generated clients across multiple languages.
				\item Implemented a gRPC to REST proxy in Go to ease frontend development where gRPC was less practical.
			\end{itemize}
			\bigskip
			\textit{Configuration Modeling}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Streamlined the network modeling and templating experience for the Network Engineers.
				\item Implemented extensive testing to ensure any model or template change would not result in a failed render for any device currently on the network.
				\item Performed frequent code reviews to ensure models and templates followed best practices.
			\end{itemize}
			\bigskip
			\textit{Process Automation}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Worked with various OpenConnect teams to tease out their common operations into repeatable, and thus automatable, business processes.
				\item Implemented numerous workflows to enact change not only on network devices, but across the various applicable sources of truth that went into managing the OpenConnect, Corporate, and Studio networks.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
		
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Principal Software Engineer}{Yahoo!}{2009 -- 2019}	
			\textit{Configuration Deployment}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed a system that deployed and validated network changes to tens of thousands of network devices across several datacenters at a controlled rate of release.
				\item Developed a Django API that covered all desired modifications to the network configuration at various hierarchy levels from the global network down to a single device.
				\item Detected and alerted on any manual changes to a network device.
				\item Modeled all configurable components of the datacenter network in MySQL.
			\end{itemize}
			\bigskip
			\textit{Network Compliance}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed plugins for parsing device configuration and state to identify non-standard and/or insecure configurations
